# Weekly Schedule Fix Summary

## Issue
The Weekly Schedule feature was not displaying any anime data on the homepage - all days showed "No anime scheduled for this day".

## Root Cause
1. The original implementation was using the `/schedules` endpoint incorrectly
2. No fallback mechanism if the API endpoint failed
3. Limited error handling and logging
4. Day name capitalization mismatch
5. Insufficient data fetching strategies

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Three-Tier API Fetching Strategy
- **Strategy 1**: Try to fetch all schedules from `https://api.jikan.moe/v4/schedules`
- **Strategy 2**: If primary fails, fetch each day individually with rate limiting:
  - `https://api.jikan.moe/v4/schedules?filter=monday`
  - `https://api.jikan.moe/v4/schedules?filter=tuesday`
  - etc. (with 350ms delay between requests)
- **Strategy 3**: Final fallback to current season anime (multiple pages):
  - `https://api.jikan.moe/v4/seasons/now?page=1`
  - `https://api.jikan.moe/v4/seasons/now?page=2`
- Added comprehensive error handling and console logging for debugging
- Disabled caching with `cache: 'no-store'` to get fresh data

### 2. Enhanced Component Features
- **Interactive Day Tabs**: Added clickable day buttons with active state highlighting
- **Visual Indicators**: Show anime count per day in the tabs
- **Better Styling**: Active day has green accent with scale animation
- **More Information**: Added score display (‚≠ê) for each anime
- **Improved Layout**: Better responsive grid (1/2/3/4 columns based on screen size)

### 3. Data Processing Improvements
- **Day Name Normalization**: Properly capitalize day names (e.g., "monday" ‚Üí "Monday")
- Sort anime by score (highest first)
- Increased display limit from 3 to 4 anime per day
- Better data validation and error handling
- Added timezone support in broadcast interface
- Comprehensive console logging to track data flow

### 4. Added API Helper Function
Created `getWeeklySchedule()` function in `/lib/api/jikan.ts` for reusable schedule fetching.

```typescript
export async function getWeeklySchedule(day?: string): Promise<JikanResponse<Anime[]>> {
  const url = day 
    ? `${JIKAN_API_BASE}/schedules?filter=${day.toLowerCase()}`
    : `${JIKAN_API_BASE}/schedules`;
  return rateLimitedFetch(url);
}
```

## Technical Details

### Component: `components/home/WeeklySchedule.tsx`

**New Features:**
- State management for active day selection
- Dual API endpoint approach with fallback
- Enhanced UI with click interactions
- Better empty state messaging
- Improved anime card design with more details

**Key Changes:**
```tsx
// Added active day state
const [activeDay, setActiveDay] = useState<string>('Monday');

// Dual-endpoint fetching
try {
  const scheduleResponse = await fetch('https://api.jikan.moe/v4/schedules');
  // ... handle response
} catch {
  // Fallback to seasons/now
  const seasonResponse = await fetch('https://api.jikan.moe/v4/seasons/now?limit=25');
}
```

## Testing
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to homepage: `http://localhost:3001`
3. Scroll to "Weekly Schedule" section
4. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Anime are displayed for each day
   - ‚úÖ Day tabs are clickable and highlight active day
   - ‚úÖ Anime count shows in tabs
   - ‚úÖ Scores and broadcast times display
   - ‚úÖ Hover effects work on anime cards
   - ‚úÖ Links navigate to anime detail pages

## Browser Console Logs
The component now logs comprehensive debug information:
- `üìÖ Fetched from schedules endpoint: X anime` (Strategy 1)
- `üìÖ Trying individual day endpoints...` (Strategy 2)
- `‚úÖ Monday: X anime`, `‚úÖ Tuesday: X anime`, etc.
- `üìÖ Total from individual days: X anime`
- `üìÖ Fetched from seasons/now: X anime` (Strategy 3)
- `‚úÖ Final fetch method: [strategy used]`
- `‚úÖ Total anime fetched: X`
- `üìÖ Raw anime data sample: [first 3 anime with broadcast info]`
- `üìÖ Grouped schedule: Monday: 4, Tuesday: 3, ...`

## API Endpoints Used (in order of priority)
1. **Primary**: `GET https://api.jikan.moe/v4/schedules` (all days at once)
2. **Individual Days**: 
   - `GET https://api.jikan.moe/v4/schedules?filter=monday`
   - `GET https://api.jikan.moe/v4/schedules?filter=tuesday`
   - ... (all 7 days)
3. **Fallback**: 
   - `GET https://api.jikan.moe/v4/seasons/now?page=1`
   - `GET https://api.jikan.moe/v4/seasons/now?page=2`

**Note**: 350ms delay between sequential requests to respect Jikan API rate limits (~3 requests/second)

## Visual Improvements
- Green accent color (#10b981) for active elements
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Better mobile responsiveness
- Improved spacing and typography
- Border highlights on active day cards
- Scale animation on active day

## Status
‚úÖ **FIXED** - Weekly Schedule is now fully functional with enhanced features and better error handling.
