# Weekly Schedule Fix - Updated

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Strict Filtering**
- **Before**: Only showed anime that were `airing: true` AND had `score > 0`
- **After**: Shows ALL anime with broadcast information, regardless of airing status or score
- This fixes the "No anime schedule available" issue

### 2. **Enhanced Console Logging**
Added detailed logs to track data flow:
```
🔄 Starting schedule fetch...
📡 Fetching from schedules endpoint...
✅ Schedules API success: 150 anime found
📊 Sample: [shows first 2 anime with broadcast info]
🔍 Processing 150 anime...
📋 Before filtering: Monday:15 | Tuesday:12 | ...
📊 Final grouped data: Monday:6 | Tuesday:6 | ...
```

### 3. **Disabled Cache**
Changed API calls to use `cache: 'no-store'` to always get fresh data

### 4. **Better Error Handling**
- Shows which API endpoint is being tried
- Logs sample data to verify format
- Shows counts before and after processing

## 🔍 How to Debug

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Go to http://localhost:3001
2. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
3. Click the **Console** tab
4. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or F5)

### Step 2: Check the Logs
You should see logs like this:

#### ✅ **Success Case:**
```
🔄 Starting schedule fetch...
📡 Fetching from schedules endpoint...
✅ Schedules API success: 150 anime found
📊 Sample: [{title: "...", day: "Mondays"}, ...]
🔍 Processing 150 anime...
📋 Before filtering: Monday:15 | Tuesday:12 | Wednesday:18 | ...
📊 Final grouped data: Monday:6 | Tuesday:6 | Wednesday:6 | ...
```

#### ⚠️ **Fallback Case:**
```
🔄 Starting schedule fetch...
📡 Fetching from schedules endpoint...
⚠️ Schedules endpoint failed with status: 404
🔄 Trying fallback: seasons/now...
✅ Season API success: 50 anime found
📊 Sample: [{title: "...", day: "Monday", airing: true}, ...]
🔍 Processing 50 anime...
```

### Step 3: Identify the Issue

#### **If you see:** `📋 Before filtering: Monday:0 | Tuesday:0 | ...`
**Problem**: Anime have no `broadcast.day` field
**Solution**: API data doesn't include schedule info - need different endpoint

#### **If you see:** `📋 Before filtering: Monday:15 | ...` but still no UI
**Problem**: React rendering issue
**Solution**: Check browser console for React errors

#### **If you see:** `⚠️ Schedules endpoint failed`
**Problem**: API is down or rate-limited
**Solution**: Wait 60 seconds and refresh, or check Jikan API status

## 🧪 Quick API Test

Paste this in browser console to test the API directly:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.jikan.moe/v4/schedules')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log('✅ Total:', data.data.length, 'anime');
    const withBroadcast = data.data.filter(a => a.broadcast?.day);
    console.log('✅ With broadcast day:', withBroadcast.length);
    console.log('✅ First 3:', withBroadcast.slice(0, 3).map(a => ({
      title: a.title,
      day: a.broadcast.day,
      time: a.broadcast.time
    })));
  });
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Total: 150 anime
✅ With broadcast day: 145
✅ First 3: [
  {title: "Some Anime", day: "Mondays", time: "23:00"},
  ...
]
```

## 📊 What Should Happen Now

When you refresh the page at http://localhost:3001:

1. **Console shows successful API fetch**
2. **Console shows anime grouped by day**
3. **Weekly Schedule section displays:**
   - Day tabs (Monday-Sunday)
   - Horizontal scrolling rows
   - Anime cards with posters, titles, times, scores
4. **Click any day tab** to highlight it
5. **Scroll horizontally** to see more anime per day
6. **Click any anime card** to view details

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

### Check These:

1. **Browser Console Errors?**
   - Look for red error messages
   - Check Network tab for failed requests

2. **API Rate Limit?**
   - Jikan API allows 60 requests/minute
   - Wait 60 seconds if you see 429 errors

3. **Data Format Changed?**
   - Check if API returns `broadcast.day` as "Monday" vs "Mondays"
   - Our code handles both formats

4. **Network Issues?**
   - Test API directly: https://api.jikan.moe/v4/schedules
   - Should return JSON with anime array

---

## 💡 Next Steps

If the console shows data is being fetched and grouped correctly but UI still shows "No anime":

1. **Check if any day has data > 0**
2. **Verify the render logic isn't filtering everything out**
3. **Check if `scheduleData` state is being set**
4. **Look for React component errors**

The detailed console logs will tell us exactly where the problem is!
