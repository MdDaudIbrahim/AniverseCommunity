---

## ✅ Verify Deployment

After deployment, check these pages:

### Must-Visit Pages:

1. **Home Page**
   - URL: `https://aniversecommunity.netlify.app/`
   - Should show: Hero, trending anime, no "Performance" section

2. **Recommendations** (The one that was old!)
   - URL: `https://aniversecommunity.netlify.app/recommendations`
   - Should show: Compact design, category buttons
   - Should NOT show: "How Recommendations Work" info section

3. **Top Anime**
   - URL: `https://aniversecommunity.netlify.app/top-anime`
   - Should show: Loading badges, 100 anime grid

4. **Seasonal**
   - URL: `https://aniversecommunity.netlify.app/seasonal`
   - Should show: Season selector (Winter/Spring/Summer/Fall)

### If Still Showing Old Version:

1. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl + F5 (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
2. **Incognito mode:** Open in private/incognito window
3. **Clear browser cache:** Settings → Clear browsing data
4. **Add cache buster:** `?v=2` at end of URL
5. **Check deploy status:** Make sure deploy shows "Published"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Failed?

**Check deploy logs for:**
- ❌ `npm install` errors → Missing dependencies
- ❌ TypeScript errors → Check `get_errors` tool output
- ❌ Next.js plugin issues → Verify `netlify.toml`

**Common fixes:**
```powershell
# Locally test build
npm run build

# Check for errors
npm run lint

# Update dependencies
npm install
```

### Site Shows 404?

- Check `netlify.toml` has correct `publish = ".next"`
- Verify Next.js plugin is installed in dashboard
- Make sure no manual redirects interfere

### Images Not Loading?

Images load from external URLs (MyAnimeList CDN):
- Some might 404 (normal - their API returns broken links sometimes)
- Next.js Image component handles this gracefully
- Not a deployment issue

### Option B: Manual Trigger

1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"**
