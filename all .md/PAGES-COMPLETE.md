lib/
├── data/
│   └── fallbackData.ts (18 curated anime)
└── api/
    └── jikan.ts (API client with rate limiting)
```

### Instant Load Pattern
All anime list pages follow this pattern:

```typescript
1. Import fallback data
2. Set as initial state (loading = false)
3. Display immediately (no spinner)
4. Fetch fresh data in background after delay
5. Update quietly if successful
6. Keep cached data if API fails
```

### Image Strategy
```typescript
// Prioritize JPG > WebP for reliability
const imageUrl = 
  anime.images.jpg.image_url || 
  anime.images.jpg.large_image_url || 
  anime.images.webp.image_url;
```

2. **Search functionality** - Make search bar functional with Jikan API
3. **Anime detail page improvements** - Add more info, recommendations, etc.

### Medium Term
4. **Local storage caching** - Save API responses to browser

6. **Filters** - By year, score, type, status

### Long Term
7. **User accounts** - Save favorites, watchlist
8. **Real recommendations** - Based on user history
