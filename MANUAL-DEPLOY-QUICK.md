## 🚀 Deploy in 2 Simple Steps

### Step 1: Build Your Site

Run this command in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\build-for-manual-deploy.ps1
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Configures your site for static export
- ✅ Builds your site into an `out` folder
- ✅ Optionally creates a ZIP file
- ✅ Opens Netlify Drop in your browser

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

---

### Step 2: Drag & Drop to Netlify

1. **The script will open:** https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. **Sign up/Login** (free account, use email or GitHub)
3. **Drag the `out` folder** into the drop zone
4. **Wait 30 seconds**
5. ✅ **Your site is LIVE!**

**Time:** 30 seconds

---

## 📋 Complete Process (Detailed)

### Before You Start:
```powershell
# Make sure you're in the project folder
cd "D:\COMPLETED PROJECTS\Aniversecommunity"
```

### Run the Build Script:
```powershell
.\build-for-manual-deploy.ps1
```

### The Script Will Ask:
1. **"Enable static export?"** → Type `Y` and press Enter
2. **"Create ZIP file?"** → Type `Y` if you want a backup (optional)
3. **"Open Netlify Drop?"** → Type `Y` to open the deployment page

### After Building:
You'll see an `out` folder in your project directory with:
```
out/
├── index.html              (Homepage)
├── top-anime.html          (Top Anime page)
├── seasonal.html           (Seasonal page)
├── genres.html             (Genres page)
├── recommendations.html    (Recommendations page)
└── _next/                  (Optimized files)
```

### Deploy to Netlify:
1. Browser opens → https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. **Drag** the entire `out` folder to the page
3. Watch the progress bar
4. Get your live URL: `https://random-name-123.netlify.app`

// TO:
  output: 'export',
  unoptimized: true,
```

### 2. Build
